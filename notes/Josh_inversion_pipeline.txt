How this all works!

1. In setup_parameters, set
  - size (depth range) of model
  - most path info
  - MINEOS parameters, e.g. number of modes, frequency range,
                       angular order range

WRAPPER
ispsi = 0; ischeckmodel = 0;
cardid = param.CARDID (= name of intial model file)
icardid = cardid (initial card name)

2. In read_model_card,
  - read in CARDPATH, CARD  (i.e. param.CARDID in setup_parameters)
      - card looks like...
          ./new_card/(cardid).card  (this is just a title - <= 80 characters)
          (if_anisotropic=1) (trec=-1) (ifdeck=1)
          (n_model_layers=763) (n_inner_core_layers=63) (n_outer_core_layers=177)
          (radius=0) (rho) (vpv) (vsv) (q_kappa) (q_mu) (vph) (vsh) (eta)
          (radius=20000) etc etc
     - if_anisotropic = 1 for anisotropic model, 0 for isotropic
     - trec: reference period (s) of model for dispersion correction
              if <= 0, no correction is made
     - ifdeck = 1 for card deck model, 0 for polynomial model
     - n_inner_core_layers and n_outer_core_layers are actuall the index of the
       top of the inner core and outer core in the cards
     - in model card, if isotropic, then VPV, VSV are specified and VPH, VSH, ETA
       are unspecified
     - Note that radius (i.e. distance from centre of Earth!) is in metres,
       rho is in kg.m^-3, velocities are in m/s (i.e. everything is in SI)
  - can also plot starting model

WRAPPER
lmodel:                  Initial model as structure
iv[sp][vh], ieta, irad:  Initial model parameters
cv[sp][vh], ceta:        Current model parameters (set to equal intial)

obs.[RL]periods:  periods of interest (read from input data periods)
obs.[RL]phv:      phase velocities
obs.[RL]std:      errors

WRAPPER PLOT 73
plot observed Love (red) and Rayleigh (blue) phase velocities
as a function of period (circles) on one plot
Later, for each iteration of the model, plot forward calculated
toroidal (red) and spherical (blue) phase velocities as a function
of period (+) on the same plot

WRAPPER PLOT 77
Plot observed Love (subplot 1,2,1) and Rayleigh (subplot 1,2,2)
phase velocities vs. period as black '+'
Later, for each iteration of the model, plot forward calculated toroidal (1,2,1)
and spheroidal(1,2,2) phase velocities as circles colour coded for iteration.


WRAPPER PLOT 78
plot intial model model in suplots
 - 1, 6, 1: Vsv
 - 1, 6, 2: Vsh
 - 1, 6, 3: Vpv
 - 1, 6, 4: Vph
 - 1, 6, 5: Eta
 - 1, 6, 6: [constant value = 1] - will be (Vsv/Vsh)^2
 Later, for each iteration after the first, plot cvsv, cvsh etc.  (In the first
 iteration, these are still the initial values at the time of plotting).  Colour
 by iteration number.

WRAPPER PLOT 79 (not actually opened until line 407)
This is the same as plot 78, but with dashed lines for each parameter showing
the uncertainties (e.g. mestc.[SV|SH etc] + mestc.[SV|SH etc]_std)


WRAPPER PLOT 80 (not actually opened until line 319)
subplot(2,2,3) - change in Love phase velocity
    In the first iteration, plot a grey shaded region showing the size of the
    uncertainty (height is observed Love_std*2/Love_phasevel as a function of period)
    Then plot on (forward.tphv - obs.Lphv)/obs.Lphv as circles coloured by iteration.
subplot(2,2,4) - change in Rayleigh phase velocity (short periods)
    As above, but for Rayleigh phase velocities and sphv.
subplot(2,2,2) - change in Rayleigh phase velocities (long periods)

WRAPPER PLOT 81 (not actually opened until line 464)
subplot(2,2,1) - toroidal Vsh frechet kernels as a function of depth for each
                 period, coloured by period
subplot(2,2,2) = toroidal Vsh frechet kernels by period
subplot(2,2,3) = spheroidal Vsh frechet kernels by period
subplot(2,2,4) = spheroidl Vsv frechet kernels by period


3. In write_mode_in(minL, -1, [ST])
  (only run if no file
    MINEOS_synthetics/MODE/TABLES/MODE.in/
        [st].model(minF)_(maxF)_b(N_[ST]modes))
      - mode table looks like
            1.d-12  1.d-12  1.d-12 .126
            [3 (if spherical) or 2 (if toroidal)]

            0
      - top line: EPS EPS1 EPS2 WGRAV   (accuracy of mode calculation)
          where EPS controls the accuracy of the integration scheme, EPS1 controls
          the precision with which a root is found, EPS2 is the minimum separation
          of two roots.  WGRAV is the frequency (rad/s) above which gravitational
          terms are neglected (much faster calculation)
      - next line: 1 (radial modes); 2 (toroidal modes); 3 (speheroidal modes)
                   4 (inner core toroidal modes); 0 (quit the program)
      - min/max L are angular order range
      - min/max F are frequency range (in mHz)
      - N_[TS]modes are number of mode branches for Love and Rayleigh
         i.e. 1 if just fundamental mode, 2 if fundamental mode & first overtone

        - cat run_nohang.s | mineos_nohang > (DATAPATH)/logS0
            Pretty sure this is what actually runs MINEOS, so
            propagating waves through the input vel model as
            specified in run_nohang and writes to the files there
            Inputs: .card file and mode file (1st and 4th lines of run_nohang)
            Outputs (DATAPATH)/XXXX.asc
              This reprints the info from the card (with all the columns in
              a different order, but they are labelled at least!), then prints the
              group and phase velocity, Q, omega etc for each mode branch.
              i.e.  converts from velocity, density, depth structure (card) to
                    surface wave observables

5a. write_MINE_mod(bot, cvsv, cvsh, depth, cvpv, cvph, ceta, [(cardid).card])
      Takes an input file and writes a finely sampled model card for MINEOS
      - card = read_model_card([param.CARDID].card)
          read in original model card
      - Masks depths above (bot) for all parameters (rad, sv, sh, pv, ph, eta)
          option to set hyperparameter 'dist' as the depth range of the
          transition between perturbed values and PREM - will do a polyfit over
          this depth range for a smooth transition.  Was set to 100 km, but now
          set to 0 km.
      - Pastes input values (cvsv, cvsh, etc) onto the bottom of the file, then
        writes the new model out to [(cardid).card]

5b. If is_kernelcalc set to 1 (as currently hardwired):
      - frun_mineos_check([cardid], 1)
          run MINEOS on the updated card
      - [frech_T, frech_S] = fmk_kernels_linear_check(cardid, ...)
          recalculate the kernels for the updated card
      (This is the same as the steps for the first iteration, except we are not
      re-doing calc_modephv, which reads in the phase velocities saved in 'forward'
      for saving to (Path_kernels_phv)(cardid).mat)

   If is_kernelcalc is set to 0, only re-runs frun_mineos_check([cardid], runtable=0).
   The runtable business is only resaving the .asc file as a .table file for the
   purposes of calculating Frechet kernels.

        updated to [icardid, num2str(iter)] after the first iteration.

        For each period, find dC[LR] - the difference between observed [LR]phv
        and calculated [ts]phv (that was read in) at the same period

        dobs = [dCL; dCR]

        Pull out vsv, vsh, vpv, vph, eta, rad  from the card for depths above (bot)
        and calculate vp_vs (vpv./vsv) and dr (gradient(rad))

        Build the G matrix - this is a n_Love_periods+n_Rayleigh_periods by
        n_depth_points*5 (SV, SH, PV, PH, ETA) matrix.  This is filled in by
        the frechet kernels for each period - first the vsv and vsh T frechet
        kernels (sensitivities from Love) rows, then the vsv, (vsh set to 0), vpv,
        vph, eta S frechet kernels (sensitivities from Rayleigh) rows:

          T_Vsv_per1  T_Vsh_per1  0  0  0      0       0      0           0           0
          T_Vsv_per2  T_Vsh_per2  0  0  0      0       0      0           0           0
GG  =   [     0           0       0  0  0  S_Vsv_per1  0  S_Vpv_per1  S_Vph_per1  S_eta_per1 ]
              0           0       0  0  0  S_Vsv_per2  0  S_Vpv_per2  S_Vph_per2  S_eta_per2
              0           0       0  0  0  S_Vsv_per2  0  S_Vpv_per2  S_Vph_per2  S_eta_per2
            where, e.g. T_Vsv_per1 is the Frechet kernel for Toroidal Vsv sensitivity
            for the first Love period.
            So to get a GG this size would be n_depth_points = 1, n_Love_periods = 2,
            n_Rayleigh_periods = 3.
            Of course, Frechet kernels are depth dependent, so each entry in the matrix
            above (include 0) would be a row vector n_depth_points long.

        (There's also quite a lot of faffing about with the water layer being stripped off
        - perhaps can remove for simplicity for land inversions)

        Model, m0 = [vsv; vsh; vpv; vph; eta] - n_depth_points*5 x 1 vector

        Predictions, Dd = GG*m0  - n_Love_periods+n_Rayleigh_periods x 1 vector
              So this is the predicted phase velocity for each period given the
              model from (card) - Frechet kernel multiplied by velocity structure

        DdCL = Dd(Lperiods) + dCL
        DdCR = Dd(Rperiods) + dCR
        Ddobs = [DdCL; DdCR]


        Make the error weight matrix, We.
        We is a diagonal matrix, with the first n_Love_periods entries = 1/Lstd(ip)
        and the rest (n_Rayleigh_periods entries) = 1/Rstd(ip)


        Then there's a whole bunch of weighting functions.
        Define the radius range for various layers - currently set as
        'bot_seds', 'top_crust', 'bot_crust', 'top_mantle'
        For each layer, extract the indices of the frechet kernels that correspond
        to that depth range - [ts]indrad_weight[2u|2l|man|manu_ani|manl_ani|man_iso]
        i.e. indices in radius for t or s kernels (weight) for some layer
        Find the lengths of all of these, e.g. L_t_cr = length(tindrad_weight2);
        L_s_cr = length(sindrad_weight2); L_cr = L_t_cr + L_s_cr;

        Apply damped least squares:  (m = (G'G + E^2 I)^-1 G' d)
          Solve Fm = f, the weighted damped least squares.
          Putting everything together, can get to the weighted, damped least squares.

              m = (G' * We * G  + ε^2 * Wm )^-1  (G' * We * d + ε^2 * Wm * <m>)

        This looks hella complicated, but it is actually equivalent to solving…
              F * m_est  = f
        			F  	=   [    sqrt(We) * G ;    εD   ]
        			f 	=   [    sqrt(We) * d ;    εD<m>   ]
        			Wm 	=   D' * D

          D is the smoothing function, where it approximates the second derivative
          by taking the adjacent parameters in the model space and finding the
          approximate gradient across them (ind-1 = 1, ind = -2, ind+1 = 1
          along the diagonal of the matrix; this is the same as finding the
          gradient on the upward side (1*ind+1 + -1*ind) minus the gradient on
          the downward side (1*ind + -1*ind-1)).  These are multiplied by
          damping parameters (damp_cr_d2, damp_man_d2_shal, damp_man_d2_deep),
          the first two of which are hardcoded to 0, i.e. no second derivative
          smoothing is applied.

          This section also defines d_lay, which (as far as I can tell) is just
          all zeroes.  D is a (L_cr + L_man) by N matrix, where e.g. L_man is the
          number of depth layers in the mantle that are being inverted for in
          both the spheroidal and toroidal Frechet kernels. N is the number of
          model parameters (number of depth points * 5 variables inverted for).

          Now, there are also constraint equations calculated.
          These are written as linearity constraints in the form H * m = h.
          So H is equivalent to D and h is equivalent to D<m>.
          Both H and h are multiplied by depth-dependent damping parameters, ε
            (vary by layer, ie. crust, upper mantle etc)

              H3: damp towards the starting model
                  These basically have H = 1 along the diagonal and
                  h = values of Vsv (for spherical indices) or Vsh (for
                  toroidal indices) from the starting model, (card).


              H6: damp water column towards starting model
                  As H3, but for the water column, so ε is much higher as the
                  velocity of water is much more constrained.

              H1: enforce eta is constant
                  These have H = 1 along the diagonal (well, in the column for
                  eta) and h = eta in the starting model.  ε is quite high.

             H2: damp Vp/Vs towards starting Vp/Vs, i.e. VP - (Vp/Vs)*VS = 0
                  These have H = -Vp/Vs (from starting model) in the column
                  corresponding to the VS estimate, and H = 1 in the column
                  corresponding to the VP estimate.  h = 0.

             H4: enforce isotropic (Vsh/Vsv)^2 = 1, i.e. dVsh - dVsv = Vsv - Vsh
                  These have H = -1 in the Vsv relevant column and H = 1 in the Vsh
                  relevant column.  h = 0.

             H42: enforce specific Xi value, i.e. Vsh - Vsv * sqrt(Xi) = 0
                  Similar to the above, but H = -sqrt(assigned Xi value) for Vsv
                  column (still H = 1 for Vsh, and h = 0).
                  Xi is (Vsh/Vsv)^2.  This is set in the damping_parameters rather
                  than read in from the model card.

            H7: preserve layer gradients
                  When this is applied, don't need the smoothness constraints,
                  hence why those damping parameters are set to 0 above.
                  These have H = 1 and -1 for adjacent layers, with
                  e.g. h = vsv(ilay) - vsv(ilay+1), i.e. starting gradient in
                  that variable between those layers.  Although actually the
                  damping parameters for these constraint equations are also
                  set to 0.  This constraint preserves the ABSOLUTE change in
                  velocities between depth points.

            H8:  constant Xi layers is how this is labelled, but it is also
                 preserving layer gradients, as H7
                  This constraint preserves the RELATIVE change in velocities
                  between depth points. I feel like this is done in a way more
                  complicated way than it needs to be!  Currently...
                  H = (1 - (Vsv_1 - Vsv_2)/(Vsv_1 + Vsv_2)) in layer 1
                  H = (-1 - (Vsv_1 - Vsv_2)/(Vsv_1 + Vsv_2)) in layer 2
                  h = 0.
                  Here, Vsv_1 and Vsv_2 are the starting model Vsv in layers 1 and 2.
                  So if you multiply this all out (remember that H * m = h),
                    (1 - (Vsv_1 - Vsv_2)/(Vsv_1 + Vsv_2))*newVsv_1 + ...
                        (-1 - (Vsv_1 - Vsv_2)/(Vsv_1 + Vsv_2))*newVsv_2 = 0
                  Which boils down to Vsv_1/Vsv_2 = newVsv_1/newVsv2.

                  So... Not sure why this cant just be
                  H = 1/Vsv_1 in layer 1
                  H = -1/Vsv_2 in layer 2
                  h = 0
                  Which would be newVsv_1/Vsv1 - newVsv_2/Vsv_2 = 0
                    i.e. Vsv_1/Vsv_2 = newVsv_1/newVsv2

            H9:  minimise the Xi jump between the crust and the mantle
                  This is just H8 again but ONLY for the depth indices
                  corresponding to right above and below the Moho.
                  The damping parameter for this is set to 0, so it doesn't
                  apply here.



          End up with a variable mest_all = Finv*f, where F is the concatenation
          of a damped version of GG and a bunch of smoothing and other a priori
          constraints, and f is the concatenation of a damped version of the
          data and the other solutions to the other constraint equations.

          Predicted phase velocities using mest (new model):
          dLRphv_pre = (GG .* Dr) * (mest_all - m0)
              (Dr is the gradient in radius)
          Lphv_pre = Lphv0 + dLRphv_pre(Lperiods)
          Rphv_pre = Rphv0 + dLRphv_pre(Rperiods)

          mest.(SV|SH|PV|PH|ETA) = mest_all(relevent indices)


        Evaluate degrees of freedom: DOF = length(f) - trace(F*Finv)

        Calculate the covaiance matrix: Cov_m = Finv*Finv'
          std_m = sqrt(diag(Cov_m))
          mest.[SV|SH|PV|PH|ETA]_std = std_m(relevent indices)
          mest.xi_std = sqrt(  (-2*SH^2/SV^3 * SV_std)^2  +  (2*SH/SV^2 * SH_std)^2   )


WRAPPER
Run
  [Tmode, ~] = read_forward_model_qfile(cardid, 'T', data.love.mode_br_iso)
  [Smode, card] = read_forward_model_qfile(cardid, 'S', data.love.mode_br_iso)
  (I think that the cards for T and S are the same?  But T is more complicated
  because of having more mode branches in the data in Josh's code)
  Now, cardid had the velocities that went into the iteration - i.e. the starting
  model.  So Tmode and Smode are the phase velocities for the starting model
  of each iteration.  And the frechet kernels are calculated using this model.
  And mestc only has the previous phase velocities (taken from forward) at this point.
Save the results:
  results.param = param
  results.obs = obs
  results.card{iter} = card
  results.Tmode{iter} = Tmode
  results.Smode{iter} = Smode
  results.Tfrech{iter} = frech_T
  results.Sfrech{iter} = frech_S
  results.forward{iter} = forward  ** these values are pulled from Tmode and Smode
  results.mest{iter} = mestc
  results.DOF{iter} = DOF

Now, plot a whole bunch of stuff (described at the top).
Again, as with these results fields, the plots are all of the state of things
BEFORE the inversion, i.e. the starting model for that iteration.

NOW update all the parameters:
cvsh = mest.SV
cvsh = mest.SH
cvpv = mest.PV
cvph = mest.PH
ceta = mest.ETA
mestc = mest

And move the output out of the way.
 - If at the last iteration, copy all the (DATAPATH)/*.q files to
      ./save_mat/(param.PROJ).(max_iteration).(max_pertubation)/
 - Delete all files from (DATAPATH) to save space

************** END OF ITERATION LOOP ******************

In the directory: ./save_mat/(param.PROJ).(max_iteration).(max_pertubation)/
Save results to (param.PROJ).mat
Make copies of ./CARDS/(cardid).card; damping_parameters.m, setup_parameters.m
(cardid corresponds to the last iteration of the model)
